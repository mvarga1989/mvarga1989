## Introduction
I am working as a postdoctoral scientist and teaching assistant at the [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry](https://igp.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/) led by Prof. Dr. [Andreas Wieser](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/group-head/prof-dr--andreas-wieser.html).

## Recent Projects
I am mainly working on projects funded by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN](https://espace.cern.ch/SU/default.aspx)) and the Swiss Federal Office of Topography ([Swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/wissen-fakten/geodaesie-vermessung.html)).

## Professional Interests and Activities

My professional interests lie in geospatial sciences and industry. I am searching for implementation of novel theoretical implementations and using them in original applications. Topic-wise I am focusing on engineering, satellite, physical, and geometric geodesy, which are fields that have an enormous potential for complementarity in a vast number of other disciplines and industries. Thus, I have been intensively working on interdisciplinary projects with academic and industry professionals from geophysics, geoinformatics, agriculture, robotics, civil engineering and architecture. 

My specific interests are in:
- geodetic reference systems (terrestrial, celestial, height and time);
- geospatial data collection, processing, integration, analysis, and interpretation using GNSS, total station, level, terrestrial laser scanner, laser tracker, camera, radar, gravimeter, and magnetometer;
- high-precision GNSS and navigation;
- geodetic networks;
- 3D reality digitization and modelling;
- geodetic monitoring of infrastructural, industrial and environmental objects;
- gravity and magnetic field modelling;
- geoid modelling.

### Selected Contributions
There are the selected research contributions, picked up from the numerous projects on which I have been working on:
- geoid and gravity field models of the Republic of Croatia, France (Auvergne), Colorado (USA), Mediterranean Sea
- proposal for the modernization of the Croatian height reference system
- development of geodetic reference system transformation algorithms, workflows and software, including distortion modelling, for several areas worldwide
- post-seismic crustal deformation analysis, following 2020 Zagreb and Petrinja's earthquakes (Republic of Croatia)
- 3D models of the cultural heritage sites
- geomagnetic network establishment and surveying for the territory of the Republic of Croatia
- geomagnetic network design of Switzerland
- concept design of the coordinate reference systems for the CERN Future Circular Collider (FCC)
- concept design of the surface and underground geodetic networks for the CERN FCC
- concept for calibration, control and testing of the geodetic equipment for the CERN FCC
- GNSS smartphone positioning and navigation in different conditions and areas (several datasets in Slovakia and the USA)
